# GrocerGo
A Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Bot made to query prices for your daily groceries.

 
## About
Searching for groceries to find the best prices across multiple platforms takes a lot of repetitive and time-consuming actions.
 
We have used the UiPath Studio application to build an RPA bot that can automate the process of querying prices across multiple popular online grocery sites. 
 
Users can enter a grocery item they wish to purchase and the bot will search this item across the different grocery sites and extract that information and collate it into an excel sheet. The excel sheet then tallies the cart prices for each store along with the products' information for the user to make informed decisions.
